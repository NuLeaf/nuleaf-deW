          NuLeaf formed in July 2015 as an independent research group that encouraged students to share ideas and create projects. We became a start up in early 2017 when we realized our biomimetic approach and focus on sustainable manufacturing in renewable energy was unique and competitive in industry.

        <p class="slide-text lead">
          We were recently accepted to an accelerator program which runs from April through July, 2017. Our goal is to continue improving our prototypes by connecting the artificial wetland and plant microbial fuel cell while reaching out to customers.
